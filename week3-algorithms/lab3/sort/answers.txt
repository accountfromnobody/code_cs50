sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: See the explanation for sort3.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: Because the real time for sorting the random texts with sort2 is the fastest than the other sorts. The random text is the worst case scenario O.
Bubble and Selection sort have the same value for O = O(n^2), in contrast to merge sort O = O(n log n). So sort2 must use merge sort then.

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: Because it took sort3 the most time to sort the already sorted text. The sorted text is the best case scenario Omega.
The Omega of selection is n^2 which is the highest value from all other algorithms. So it must use more steps and therefore it needs more time
than the other algorithms. We already know that sort2 is merge sort, so sort1 use bubble sort.
